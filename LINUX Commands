1.	LINUX is open source OS built upon linux kernel which is a brain of OS and it manages how computer interacts with it’s h/w and resources.
2.	The Linux operating system is a set of programs which acts as a link between the computer and the end user.
3.	The computer programs that allocate the system resources and coordinate all the details of the computer's internals is called the Operating System 
    or the Kernelmemory management, task scheduling and file management.
4.	Users communicate with the Kernel through a program known as the shell. The shell is a command line interpreter; it translates commands entered by 
    the user and converts them into a language that is understood by the kernel.
5.	h/w-->kernel-->shell-->Application programs
6.	Kernel − The kernel is the heart of the Linux operating system. It interacts with the hardware and most of the tasks like memory management, 
    task scheduling and file management.
7.	Shell − The shell is the utility that processes your requests. When you type in a command at your terminal, the shell interprets the command
    and calls the program that you want. The shell uses standard syntax for all commands. C Shell, Bourne Shell and Korn Shell are the most famous 
    shells which are available with most of the Unix variants.
